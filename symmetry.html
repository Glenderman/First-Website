  <p> To distinguish a film made by Anderson, there are many features, like the colour palettes and the characters but a deep-love added into all of his compositions is symmetry amongst shots, and this can be traces through his time of making film. Traces of symmetry can be seen in all of his early movies, of course, but cut to present, and his initial obsession has bloomed into full-blown mania. <br>
    <br>
    The man simply cannot resist the draw of reciprocal arrangement of props and characters in front of his camera. This attribute pops up in Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, but check out everything from The Royal Tenenbaums onward, and it becomes more and more prevalent. <br>
    <br>
    Some may argue against his philosophy, instead advocating techniques that diffuse the symmetry Anderson has become known for (and which he most likely got through his love for Stanley Kubrick). But for Anderson, symmetry is a very necessary piece of his signature. Anderson's penchant for centering shots isn't just an overindulgent quirk. It's actually proof that symmetry can be a highly effective visual technique. Here are 5 things you can learn from the director's symmetrical style.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1. Humans Naturally Love Symmetry</strong> <br>
    <br>
    Our brains are hardwired to love symmetry. Humans tend to judge physical attractiveness based on facial symmetry. Its effect is so powerful that "even infants as young as 4 months old recognize and prefer symmetry." As a design technique, symmetry can be a kind of shortcut to creating impactful imagery. We're already programmed to like and respond to it, making symmetry as close to a guarantee as you can get in design work. It also might explain why Anderson has such a loyal, dedicated following. Anderson "is a cool example of how biology intersects with art, shaping why we love the things we do." <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2. Symmetry Creates Points of Interest</strong> <br>
    <br>
    There's no magic formula for capturing a viewer's attention, but using Anderson-style symmetry may come close. In the words of renowned film scholar David Bordwell, the kind of central perspective used by Anderson "helps drive your eye to the main items" in an image. In short, Wes Anderson's symmetrical style makes you look exactly where the director wants you to look. But Anderson does more than just gaming the system. He's also giving you something worth looking at. As the School of Digital Photography notes, a symmetrical shot needs two elements in order to be effective: "a strong composition and an eye catching point of interest." Wes Anderson accomplishes that by using rich colors, fascinating characters, and quirky objects in his shots. To accomplish the same thing, create a focal point worth looking at, then use symmetry to guide a viewer's eye towards it. <br>
    <br>
    <strong> 3. Symmetry Can Create Unique, Effective Portraits </strong> <br>
    <br>
    We're all familiar with the rule of thirds, particularly the assertion that centered, straight-on composition diminishes visual interest - especially when doing portraits. Wes Anderson's style flies in the face of that. Bordwell argues that Anderson's style can create a "'painterly' or strong pictorial approach" whose "stasis and passivity carries the connotations of a posed photograph." Or, given Anderson's love of large group shots, even evokes "over-posed high school yearbook shots." The next time you work on a portrait, why not forget the rule of thirds for a moment and use a little symmetry to make that image really pop? <br>
    <br>
    <strong> 4. Symmetry Can Be Funny </strong> <br>
    <br>
    Wes Anderson's movies can be hilarious, but the humor doesn't just come from the dialogue. Bordwell writes that symmetry can create a "static geometrical frame [that] can evoke a deadpan comic quality." Anderson's movies demonstrate that symmetrical shots can make almost anything amusingly offbeat. That's well worth remembering when you want to introduce a bit of humor or whimsy into your next project. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>5. Symmetry Makes Information More Accessible</strong><br>
    <br>
    We've all heard of the studies that suggest that the more symmetrical a face is, the more beautiful we perceive it to be. A large part of that is how "symmetry brings aesthetically pleasing balance and proportion" to images. But symmetry doesn't just make images more appealing. It also "increases the ease with which information is processed." Without symmetry, many of the images in Anderson's films would appear oppressively busy or cluttered. But in his capable hands, the clutter becomes accessible visual stimuli, easily understood and powerfully affecting. This makes symmetry ideal for infographics and other information-heavy image projects.

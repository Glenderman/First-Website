  <p>Wes Anderson; cinema extraordinaire. Anderson, an American film director who is known for his distinctive visuals, and narrative style. He regularly collaborates on film projects with an odd ensemble of actors including brothers Luke and Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman.
    His films are best known for being quirky, comical and having an array of flawed characters, with films ranging from Golden Globe winner: The Royal Tenenbaums to the critical sensation: The Grand Budapest Hotel. <br>
    <br>
    The first thing that gives away a Wes Anderson film is the look of the film; it is unlike anything you'll ever watch, his films are a visual wonder, watch Rushmore, or Fantastic Mr. Fox and you will wonder who crafted this work of art. <br>
    <br>
    Not one factor contributes to Wes Andersons easily distinguishable work, there are a host of them at play in every single one of his films. There are a number of factors that contribute to making a recognizable Anderson product. It's not simply one thing or the other; it's not the way that he captures shots, composes images, or dresses up his sets (and his characters, for that matter), but rather all of these details and more taken in total. <br>

    Wesley Wales Anderson was born on May 1, 1969, in Houston, Texas, the son of Texas Ann (Burroughs), a realtor and archaeologist, and Melver Leonard Anderson, who worked in advertising and public relations. He is the second of three boys; his parents divorced when he was eight. His elder brother, Mel, is a physician, and his younger brother, Eric, is a writer and artist whose paintings and designs have appeared in several of Anderson's films. Anderson is of Swedish and Norwegian ancestry. <br>
    <br>
    He graduated from St. John's School in Houston in 1987, which he later used as a prominent location throughout Rushmore. As a child, Anderson made silent films on his father's Super 8 camera, starring his brothers and friends, although his first ambition was to be a writer. Anderson attended college while working part-time as a cinema projectionist. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in philosophy in 1990, where he met future frequent collaborator Owen Wilson. </p>
